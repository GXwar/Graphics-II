# Graphics II Render Project
Since this project used the `type="module"` feature to structure the project, you cannot run the index.html file directly. You need a local server to run the index.html file to avoid the CORS.

* Lab 1 ([Preview](https://gxwar.github.io/Graphics-II/Lab1/index))

  For this project, I used javascript.

  There are 2 ways you could use to run the project.

  1. Click the Preview above to view the project through github pages.
  2. Install a local server to open the /Lab1/index.html.

* Lab 2 ([Preview](https://gxwar.github.io/Graphics-II/Lab2/index))

  For this project, I migrated it to TypeScript to reduce overall bug density and get more IDE Supports.

  There are 3 ways you could use to run the project.

  1. Click the Preview above to view the project through github pages.
  2. Install a local server to open the /Lab2/index.html.
  3. Install node environment and npm. Open the terminal, enter /Lab2 directory, and then enter command `npm install && npm run build && npm start`. (I writed a mini server in `/Lab2/server.js` with node.js, so it is similar way with approach 2)
